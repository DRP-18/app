# Experiment: Calendar
---

## Assumption
I am assuming that tutors and tutees would want to manage their sessions in-app. This is important as if they do not want the app to manage their sessions, then the overall hypothesis that tutors and tutees want a single unified experience is moot.

## Falsifiable Hypothesis
Having an in-app calendar will reduce the time taken for tutors and tutees to book a session by at least 40%, assuming the tutors and tutees start in the app.

## Test plan
Tutors and tutees will be given a logged into the app, and asked to book a session for Saturday at 10am and return to the home screen. Then they will be asked to reschedule their session for Sunday 3pm and return  to the home screen. Finally they will be asked to delete their session.
